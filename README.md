# Idea
I have found a website that is offering some logos [logoground.com](https://logoground.com/) and found the descriptions could be cool domain names.
So I scraped the website, cleaned up some of the words and special chars and checked the domains for the words with dns and whois queries.

Because I lost interest in creating a proper website, I just generated some static websites to look at the domains:

# Only free .com domains:
[Free Com Domains](https://logodomains.steve.pm/com/1.html)

# Free .io where .com is registered:
[Free io Domains](https://logodomains.steve.pm/io/1.html)

# Free .com and .io domains:
[Free Com And Io Domains](https://logodomains.steve.pm/all/1.html)


Domains were checked on 2022-09-10 with dns and whois queries.
